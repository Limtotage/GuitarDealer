Project Description

This project was developed entirely from scratch in just one week during a Game Jam event. The main idea was to challenge creativity and problem-solving under strict time limits, while experimenting with unique mechanics and storytelling.

The game explores themes of corruption, downfall, and choices, presented through an unusual medium — guitars and guitar cases — which are used as symbols for money laundering and corruption. One of the story-driven stages demonstrates how chasing corruption ultimately leads to collapse.

The project was created with the spirit of prototyping in mind:

⏱️ Built under a one-week deadline

🎮 Designed specifically for the Game Jam’s theme

🛠️ Focused on gameplay first, with minimal but meaningful assets

🌍 Developed with the intention to share, learn, and improve

This repository contains the full source code and assets used during the jam. It is not a polished commercial product, but rather a creative prototype that shows what can be achieved within a very limited time frame. Future improvements and refinements may follow after the jam.
